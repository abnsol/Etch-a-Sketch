# Etch-a-Sketch


This project is an implementation of a classic Etch-a-Sketch toy, developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It focuses on manipulating the DOM using JavaScript, leveraging CSS Flexbox for layout, using the `opacity` CSS property, and handling various events.

## Features

- Interactive drawing on a grid
- Adjustable grid size
